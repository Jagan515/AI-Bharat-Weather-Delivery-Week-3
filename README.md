# Weather-Delivery Correlation Dashboard

An interactive dashboard that analyzes the relationship between weather patterns and online delivery demand, revealing how temperature, rainfall, and humidity influence ordering behavior.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project combines weather data with delivery demand patterns to uncover insights about consumer behavior during different weather conditions. The dashboard provides real-time visualizations, geographic mapping, and correlation analysis.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API with data simulation and weather integration
- **Frontend**: React dashboard with interactive charts and maps
- **Data**: Weather API integration + simulated delivery events
- **Visualization**: Chart.js, Leaflet maps, correlation matrices

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time weather data integration
- Simulated delivery demand patterns
- Interactive correlation analysis
- Geographic heat maps
- Trend visualization and insights
- Responsive dashboard design

## 📊 Key Insights Explored

- Temperature vs. order volume correlation
- Rainfall impact on delivery patterns
- Humidity effects on food/grocery orders
- Geographic distribution of weather-influenced demand
- Seasonal and hourly trends
